This is the code repository for [LLVM Techniques, Tips, and Best Practices Clang and Middle-End Libraries](https://www.packtpub.com/in/programming/llvm-techniques-tips-and-best-practices?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781838824952), published by Packt.

**Design powerful and reliable compilers using the latest libraries and tools from LLVM**

## What is this book about?
Every programmer or engineer, at some point in their career, works with compilers for optimizing their applications. Compilers convert a high-level programming language into low-level machine-executable code. LLVM provides the infrastructure, reusable libraries, and tools needed for developers to build their own compilers. With LLVM's extensive set of tooling, you can effectively generate code for different backends as well as optimize them. 

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Find out how LLVM’s build system works and how to reduce the building resource
* Get to grips with running custom testing with LLVM’s LIT framework
* Build different types of plugins and extensions for Clang
* Customize Clang’s toolchain and compiler flags
* Write LLVM passes for the new PassManager
* Discover how to inspect and modify LLVM IR
* Understand how to use LLVM’s profile-guided optimizations (PGO) framework
* Create custom compiler sanitizers

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
clang -fplugin=/path/to/MyPlugin.so … foo.cpp
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for software engineers of all experience levels who work with LLVM. If you are an academic researcher, this book will help you learn useful LLVM skills in a short time and enable you to build your prototypes and projects quickly. Programming language enthusiasts will also find this book useful for building a new programming language with the help of LLVM.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-12).
